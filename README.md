[ Power Bi researchs and trainings ] 

Data analysis is like having a superpower to understand the world around us. Imagine you're a detective looking for clues in a bunch of numbers and data to solve a mystery. That's basically data analysis! ️‍

**Why is it so important for businesses?**

Businesses use data analysis to make better decisions. For example, they can analyze their product sales to know which ones are the most popular and which ones are not selling so well. They can also analyze their customer data to better understand their needs and offer them personalized products and services. It's like having a crystal ball for the future! 

**Types of data analysis:**

As you mentioned, there are different types of data analysis, each with a different focus:

* **Descriptive:** This type of analysis tells us what is happening. For example, how many sales did we have last month? What is the average age of our customers? It's like taking a picture of the present. 
* **Diagnostic:** This analysis helps us understand why something is happening. For example, why did sales drop by 10%? What factors influenced that result? It's like investigating the causes of a problem. 
* **Predictive:** This analysis uses past data to predict the future. For example, how many sales will we have next month? Which products will be the most popular? It's like making a prediction based on the evidence. 
* **Prescriptive:** This analysis tells us what actions we should take to achieve the best results. For example, what marketing strategies should we implement to increase sales? How can we improve our customer satisfaction? It's like receiving personalized recommendations. 
* **Cognitive:** This type of analysis uses artificial intelligence to analyze complex data and find hidden patterns. For example, which groups of customers have similar behaviors? What trends can we identify in the market? It's like having an intelligent assistant that helps us make decisions. 

**In summary:**

Data analysis is a powerful tool that allows businesses to better understand their business, make better decisions, and anticipate the future. It's like having a team of experts working for you! ‍‍

## Data Analyst Tasks

Here's a breakdown of the tasks a data analyst typically handles, keeping it simple and clear:

* **Preparation:**  This is like getting all your ingredients ready before you start cooking. A data analyst gathers the data from different sources, cleans it up (like removing duplicates or errors), and makes sure it's in a format that can be easily used.

* **Modeling:** Here, the analyst organizes the data into a structure that makes sense. It's like creating a blueprint for a house. They might create tables, relationships, and categories to make the data easier to understand and analyze.

* **Visualization:** This is where the analyst turns the data into pictures, like charts and graphs. It's like an artist creating a painting. Visualizations make it easier to see patterns, trends, and insights in the data.

* **Analysis:** Now, the analyst starts digging into the data, looking for answers to questions. It's like a detective solving a case. They might use statistical methods, compare different groups, or identify trends to draw conclusions.

* **Administration:** This involves managing the data and the tools used for analysis. It's like a librarian keeping the books organized. The analyst might also be responsible for data security, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable, and documenting the analysis process.

These tasks often overlap and are iterative, meaning an analyst might go back and forth between them as needed

## Power BI
Power BI is a powerful tool for creating reports and analyzing data. It has three main components:

* **Power BI Desktop**: This is a free desktop application that you can use to connect to your data, create reports, and design visualizations. It's like your personal workshop for building reports.

* **Power BI Service**: This is a cloud-based platform where you can publish and share your reports with others. It's like a central hub where everyone can access and collaborate on reports.

* **Power BI Mobile**: This is a mobile app that lets you view and interact with your reports on the go. It's like having your reports in your pocket, so you can access them anytime, anywhere.

### General Workflow in Power BI
Here's a breakdown of the Power BI workflow, along with some extra info:

Power BI is a great tool for turning data into clear and insightful reports. Here's how it generally works:

1. **Connect to your data:** You start by using Power BI Desktop to connect to your data. This data could be in a spreadsheet, a database, or even online. It's like gathering all the ingredients you need for a recipe.

2. **Transform and model the data:** Next, you use Power BI Desktop to clean up and organize your data. This might involve removing errors, filling in missing information, or creating relationships between different sets of data. It's like prepping your ingredients before you start cooking.

3. **Create visualizations and reports:** Now, you can start creating charts, graphs, and other visuals to represent your data. You can also combine these visuals into interactive reports that tell a story. It's like using your ingredients to create a delicious meal.

4. **Publish the report to the Power BI service:** Once you're happy with your report, you can publish it to the Power BI service, which is a website where you can share your reports with others. It's like sharing your recipe with friends and family.

5. **Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service:** In the Power BI service, you can share your reports with specific people or groups, and you can also manage how your reports are accessed and used. It's like making sure everyone gets to enjoy your delicious meal.

The Power BI service also has some extra features:

* **Dashboards:** You can create dashboards that provide a high-level overview of your key metrics and insights. It's like having a summary of all your recipes in one place.

* **Apps:** You can bundle related reports and dashboards into apps, making it easier for people to find and use the information they need. It's like creating a cookbook with all your favorite recipes.

Power BI is a powerful tool that can help you turn your data into actionable insights. By following this workflow, you can create reports that are both informative and engaging.

### Semantic and Visualizations
You're absolutely right! In Power BI, semantic models and visualizations are the core building blocks. Think of them as the ingredients and the presentation of a delicious dish.

**Semantic models:** Imagine you have a box full of ingredients (data). A semantic model is like a recipe that tells you how to combine those ingredients to create something tasty. It organizes and defines the data so that Power BI understands what it is and how it relates to each other. In this stage you should connect, clean and model de data before do the analisys.

**Visualizations:** Once you have your dish prepared (semantic model), visualizations are how you present it. They're like the photos in a cookbook that show you what the finished dish looks like. Visualizations can be charts, tables, maps, etc., and help you understand the data at a glance.

Together, semantic models and visualizations allow you to create interactive and easy-to-understand reports that help you make better decisions.
