# Data Analisys and PowerBi
[ Power Bi researchs and trainings ] 

Data analysis is like having a superpower to understand the world around us. Imagine you're a detective looking for clues in a bunch of numbers and data to solve a mystery. That's basically data analysis! ️‍

**Why is it so important for businesses?**

Businesses use data analysis to make better decisions. For example, they can analyze their product sales to know which ones are the most popular and which ones are not selling so well. They can also analyze their customer data to better understand their needs and offer them personalized products and services. It's like having a crystal ball for the future! 

**Types of data analysis:**

As you mentioned, there are different types of data analysis, each with a different focus:

* **Descriptive:** This type of analysis tells us what is happening. For example, how many sales did we have last month? What is the average age of our customers? It's like taking a picture of the present. 
* **Diagnostic:** This analysis helps us understand why something is happening. For example, why did sales drop by 10%? What factors influenced that result? It's like investigating the causes of a problem. 
* **Predictive:** This analysis uses past data to predict the future. For example, how many sales will we have next month? Which products will be the most popular? It's like making a prediction based on the evidence. 
* **Prescriptive:** This analysis tells us what actions we should take to achieve the best results. For example, what marketing strategies should we implement to increase sales? How can we improve our customer satisfaction? It's like receiving personalized recommendations. 
* **Cognitive:** This type of analysis uses artificial intelligence to analyze complex data and find hidden patterns. For example, which groups of customers have similar behaviors? What trends can we identify in the market? It's like having an intelligent assistant that helps us make decisions. 

**In summary:**

Data analysis is a powerful tool that allows businesses to better understand their business, make better decisions, and anticipate the future. It's like having a team of experts working for you! ‍‍

## Data Analyst Tasks

Here's a breakdown of the tasks a data analyst typically handles, keeping it simple and clear:

* **Preparation:**  This is like getting all your ingredients ready before you start cooking. A data analyst gathers the data from different sources, cleans it up (like removing duplicates or errors), and makes sure it's in a format that can be easily used.

* **Modeling:** Here, the analyst organizes the data into a structure that makes sense. It's like creating a blueprint for a house. They might create tables, relationships, and categories to make the data easier to understand and analyze.

* **Visualization:** This is where the analyst turns the data into pictures, like charts and graphs. It's like an artist creating a painting. Visualizations make it easier to see patterns, trends, and insights in the data.

* **Analysis:** Now, the analyst starts digging into the data, looking for answers to questions. It's like a detective solving a case. They might use statistical methods, compare different groups, or identify trends to draw conclusions.

* **Administration:** This involves managing the data and the tools used for analysis. It's like a librarian keeping the books organized. The analyst might also be responsible for data security, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable, and documenting the analysis process.

These tasks often overlap and are iterative, meaning an analyst might go back and forth between them as needed
